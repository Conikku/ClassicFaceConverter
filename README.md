###### ClassicHeadConversion converts Dynamic heads to their classic face and head counterparts.
###### This was originally made for my game [Super Sonic Robloxia Adventure](https://www.roblox.com/games/10417853509/Super-Sonic-Robloxia-Adventure/) as it is a Classic Roblox styled Sonic fan game and it uses Roblox's classic face system to change the face of a player via a decal in the player's head

## Installation
